# My Data Engineering Learning Journey

This repository contains all my practice projects and code as I follow the [Data Engineering Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/Data-Engineering-Roadmap-By-Data-With-Baraa-239080cfd3d4800e83d0c94ba5880247).

    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd data-engineering-journey
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
